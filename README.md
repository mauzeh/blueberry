Blueberry
=========

A very simple PHP framework that was once used before Zend_Framework, Symfony, or Drupal.

Blueberry offers:

- a model, view, controller architecture,
- database abstraction,
- acl support (entity level and action level),
- forms,
- recursive menu trees with acl integration,
- templates.

It can be of benefit for very simple applications. Sensible performance ceiling:

- 1,000 users
- 1,000 rows per MySQL table.
